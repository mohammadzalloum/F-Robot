# ü§ñ f-tobot

This is an autonomous agricultural scout robot designed to navigate farmlands, perform planting and watering tasks, and monitor environmental conditions. It integrates environmental sensors, a high-resolution camera, front-facing LED lights, and can be fully controlled via a mobile application through Bluetooth.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Navigation & Sensing**: Robot drives autonomously using motor drivers and avoids obstacles via ultrasonic sensor.  
2. **Planting & Watering**: At designated locations, servo lowers seeds into soil and water pump irrigates them.  
3. **Data Collection**: Sensors record temperature, humidity, light intensity, wind speed, and rain, sending data to the mobile app.  
4. **Remote Operation**: Users can override autonomous behavior, view live video, and control functions from the app.

## üì± Mobile App

- Connect to `HC-06` Bluetooth module (default PIN: `1234`).  
- Real-time controls for movement, planting, watering, and LED lights.  
- Live streaming of camera feed and sensor data dashboard.
